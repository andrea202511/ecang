Utility to convert pcapng log file with ethercat frames (by wireshark) to csv file

## Introduction

To diagnose a problem or simply to study the internal flow of information in an ethercat fieldbus, one of the common practices is to capture the flow of ethercat datagrams with an ethernet sniffer such as Wireshark (www.wireshark.org).
Wireshark provides some filters to facilitate data analysis but the high amount of recorded information still makes an analysis complicated for many people who do not have a very deep knowledge of the ethercat protocol and Wireshark tools.
Ecang can help these people!

Ecang extracts the list of PDOs exchanged in an ethercat network directly from the network configuration file (.xml), thanks to this data it can read numerous information from the file generated by the sniffer (.pcapng) and transfers them to a comma-separated values ​​file (.csv) already applying a first level of validation. Subsequently the user can open the csv file with his favorite spreadsheet (Libreoffice Calc, Openoffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, etc.) and with formulas and other tools he can better analyze and filter the data according to his needs.

## Requirements

Ecang use the wxWidgets library (www.wxwidgets.org). These libraries are requested:

Ecang is develop with Code:Blocks (www.codebloks.org). In the src folder, codeblocks projet can be found;


## Istallation
Linux. Deb pachages are disposable. Download them from and install with your pakage manager preferred
from prompt can use dpgk

sudo dpkg -i ecang_1_.... .deb

Also installer for windows system will be ready..  //TODO
## Internals
Ecang exctracts the list of PDO reading the branch EtherCATConfig/Config/ProcessImage/Inputs and EtherCATConfig/Config/ProcessImage/Outputs
