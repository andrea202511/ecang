To diagnose a problem or simply to study the internal flow of information in an ethercat fieldbus, one of the common practices is to capture the flow of ethercat datagrams with an ethernet sniffer such as Wireshark (www.wireshark.org).<BR>
Wireshark provides some filters to facilitate data analysis but the high amount of recorded information still makes an analysis too hard for many people who do not have a very deep knowledge of the ethercat protocol and Wireshark tools.<BR>
Ecang can help these people!<P>

Ecang extracts the list of the slaves managed and the PDOs exchanged in an ethercat network directly from the network configuration file (ENI file) .xml, thanks to this data it can read numerous information from the file generated by the sniffer (.pcapng) and transfers them to a comma-separated values &#8203;&#8203;file (.csv) already applying a first level of validation. Subsequently the user can open the csv file with his favorite spreadsheet (Libreoffice Calc, Openoffice Calc, Microsoft Excel, etc.)<P>
