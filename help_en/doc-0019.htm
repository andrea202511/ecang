<H2>Filter dialog</H2>

In the FILTER dialog all the components that can be extracted from the PCAPNG file being processed are listed.<BR>
For each SLAVE it is possible to select READ/WRITE access to the registers (REG), the mailbox communication (SDO) and all the process data exchange (PDOs)<BR>
At the top, three pairs of buttons allow you to select/deselect each category with a single click. In the list, you can act in a more targeted manner by selecting each individual element.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Tips:<BR>
Although it is possible to select all the elements, this could lead to a very large CSV file that is difficult to consult.<BR>
If you are investigating a problem with the power-up of a specific slave, it will probably be interesting to check the registers (REG) and mailbox communication (SDO) of the slave, vice versa if you are interested in the information that is exchanged during operation, selecting the affected PDOs will be the best choice
