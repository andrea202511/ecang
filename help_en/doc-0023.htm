<H2>ENI file</H2>
The ENI (EtherCAT Network Information) file is the configuration file used in EtherCAT networks to describe the network topology and connected devices.
The ENI file is usually in XML format, and is generated or modified using configuration tools such as EtherCAT configuration software (for example, EtherCAT Configurator or TwinCAT from Beckhoff).<P>
Currently Ecang extracts only this information from the ENI file:<BR>
From the <B>&lt;config/slave/info&gt;</B> section, the name and address of each slave are read<BR>
From the <B>&lt;ProcessImage/Inputs&gt;</B> section the name, size and offset of each input PDO are read<BR>
From the <B>&lt;ProcessImage/Output&gt;</B> section the name, size and offset of each output PDO are read<BR><P>
While reading the ENI file a report of the extracted information is displayed in the main window.<P>
